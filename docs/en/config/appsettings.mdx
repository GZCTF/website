# appsettings.json

`appsettings.json` is the core configuration file of GZCTF, which is configured by mounting into the container. This document will introduce the meaning of each field in the configuration file.

:::info

You need to restart the GZCTF service every time you update `appsettings.json` to make it effective.

:::

## Configuration fields

### ConnectionStrings

Here we can the configure the connection of the database.

#### `Database`

This field is required.

GZCTF uses PostgreSQL as the backend database and data persistence

:::info

GZCTF only supports PostgreSQL as the database, and does not support MySQL and other databases. Please fill in the correct database connection settings in the configuration file.

:::

#### `RedisCache`

This field is optional.

GZCTF uses Redis as the cache and message queue. In the case of single instance deployment, Redis is not necessary, and GZCTF's memory cache can be used directly; in the case of multi-instance deployment, Redis is necessary as a shared cache and SignalR's Scale-Out broadcast.

In v1.0 and later, GZCTF supports using [Garnet](https://github.com/microsoft/garnet) as the cache service.

#### `Storage`

This field is optional.

GZCTF supports external storage services like AWS S3 and Azure Blob Storage. You can configure the storage service to store files and other data.

:::

### XorKey

Here we can configure the encryption key for encrypting the private key of the competition in the database. It can string of any length.

### ContainerProvider

Heer we can configure the container backend which is required for creating containers dynamically during the game.

- **Type:** Type of the container backend: `Docker` or `Kubernetes`。
- **PublicEntry:** Public entry of the container backend, used to generate the address of the competition, and show to the participating teams.
- **PortMappingType:** Port mapping type, can be `Default` or `PlatformProxy`。
- **EnableTrafficCapture:** Enable/Disable traffic capture, only available when `PortMappingType` is configured as `PlatformProxy`. Captured traffic will be saved to `/app/files/capture`.

#### Docker

- **SwarmMode:** Use Swarm mode, GZCTF will use Swarm API to manage the containers if this is enabled.

:::warning

Since Docker Swarm is no longer an active project, security features are far behind k8s, and it is not recommended.

:::

- **Uri:** Docker API Server Address
  - If you use local docker, please leave Uri empty, and mount `/var/run/docker.sock` into the container.
  - If you use external docker, please set Uri to the corresponding docker API Server, **external API authentication has not been implemented, this deployment method is not recommended**

- **ChallengeNetwork:** Specify the network where the challenge container is located. If not specified, the default network will be used.

- **UserName, Password:** Docker API Basic Auth username and password, optional.

#### Kubernetes

- **Namespace:** Kubernetes namespace, used to create the namespace of the challenge instance, the default is `gzctf-challenges`
- **ConfigPath:** Kubernetes configuration file path, used to connect to the cluster, default value is `kube-config.yaml`
- **AllowCIDR:** White list of CIDR that can access the Pod
- **DNS:** custom DNS server list

To use the default behavior, please put the cluster connection configuration into the `kube-config.yaml` file and mount it to the `/app` directory. Do not change it if you don't understand the behavior of the experimental function.

:::info

Please note that you need to change the `server` field in the `kube-config.yaml` file to point to the API Server address of the cluster. The default address of the cluster is generally `https://127.0.0.1:6443`, which needs to be changed to the actual address of the cluster.

:::

:::info

In order to meet the network policy, GZCTF will create a NetworkPolicy named `gzctf-policy` in the Namespace of the challenge to restrict access. GZCTF will automatically detect whether this NetworkPolicy already exists. If it exists, it will not be created again, so you can customize the network policy by creating or editing this NetworkPolicy.

:::

### RequestLogging

Enable/Disable request logging, if enabled, detailed information of each request will be appended to the log. Static file requests are not included in the output here.

:::warning

This configuration item will record specific request information, which can **significantly impact** the log file size and platform concurrency performance. Please enable it only during debugging.

:::

### DisableRateLimit

Enable/Disable request rate limit, if enabled, the request rate of each IP and API will be limited according to the preset rules.

:::danger

**This feature is the fundamental to the security of GZCTF, take your own risk when disabling it.**

In most cases, there is no situation where users can reach the rate limit. If you encounter frequent triggering of the rate limit and abnormal IP information in the backend logs (such as a large number of requests from the same IP), please check the **trusted proxy configurations**.

With this configuration enabled, GZCTF can use minimal resources to block malicious requests that exceed normal requests by dozens of times, ensuring the platform’s stable operation.

:::

### RegistryConfig

::: warning

**This configuration item is about to be deprecated, please use the `Registries` field to define it.**

:::

### Registries

Here we can configure the username and password of the Docker Registry, which is used to pull the container image for dynamic container during the game.

```json
"Registries": {
  "ghcr.io": {
    "UserName": "...",
    "Password": "ghp_..."
  },
  "docker.io": {
    "UserName": "...",
    "Password": "..."
  },
  "your.custom.registry": {
    "UserName": "...",
    "Password": "..."
  }
}
```

You can customize the configuration of other registries according to the above format. The `UserName` and `Password` fields are required.

:::info

Please make sure that the password does not contain special characters (such as `":@` etc., but `_` can be used), otherwise it may cause template injection problems and make `Secret` not work properly.

:::

### CaptchaConfig

Configure the CAPTCHA used for user registration, account recovery and login, optional.

- **Provider:** CAPTCHA provider, can be `None`, `HashPow` or `CloudflareTurnstile`
- **SiteKey:** CAPTCHA Sitekey
- **SecretKey:** CAPTCHA Secretkey

:::tip

To ensure security and avoid malicious registration and email consumption, it is strongly recommended to enable the CAPTCHA function.

It is recommended to use the `CloudflareTurnstile` CAPTCHA provider, [related documentation](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/turnstile/).

:::

#### HashPow

:::info

**Secure context**: This feature is available only in [secure contexts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts) (HTTPS).

:::

- **Difficulty:** Difficulty of HashPow captcha, used to specify the number of leading zeros in the hash bits. The available range is from 8 to 48.

#### GoogleRecaptcha

:::danger DEPRECATED

This feature is deprecated and will be removed in `v1.2.2` due to the lack of maintenance of upstream dependency.

Please use the `CloudflareTurnstile` CAPTCHA provider instead.

:::

Configure the Google Recaptcha v3 related information, optional.

- **VerifyAPIAddress:** Google Recaptcha verify API address
- **RecaptchaThreshold:** Google Recaptcha threshold, used to determine whether the captcha is effective

### ForwardedOptions

Here we can configure the reverse proxy, which is used to get the real IP address, optional.

- **ForwardedHeaders:** Enum for ForwardedHeaders in reverse proxy, please use `7` as the default value. For more details, see [ForwardedHeaders Enum](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.httpoverrides.forwardedheaders)
- **ForwardLimit:** Limit the number of proxy hops allowed, the default is `1`
- **ForwardedForHeaderName:** The name of the reverse proxy IP address header
- **TrustedNetworks:** List of trusted networks for reverse proxy, represented by CIDR.
- **TrustedProxies:** List of trusted proxies for reverse proxy, represented by IP addresses or domain names.

:::info

If you want to ignore the trust list of reverse proxies and allow any IP address to access, please refer to the solution for forwarding Linux and non-IIS reverse proxies, and set the environment variable `ASPNETCORE_FORWARDEDHEADERS_ENABLED` to `true`.

:::

For other fields, please refer to the official documentation: [Configure ASP.NET Core to work with proxy servers and load balancers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer) and [ForwardedHeadersOptions class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.forwardedheadersoptions)

### Kestrel

::: warning In most cases, you don't need to modify the Kestrel configuration.

Kestrel is the built-in web server used by GZCTF.

With this configuration, you can control the behavior of Kestrel, such as specifying the HTTP protocol, modifying the request size limit, and more.

For other configurable fields, please refer to the properties of the `KestrelServerOptions` class in the official documentation: [KestrelServerOptions class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.server.kestrel.core.kestrelserveroptions)
